                The goal of this website is to help Australians find the perfect laptop.<br>
                This is my project for my Data Visualisation course at Swinburne University.<br> 
                I was originally inspired by a similar visualisation for cars shown in class in the early weeks. 
                I thought how nice it would be to have something similar for computers, mainly laptops, since I have bought quite a few over the years.
                <br><br>
                I remember saving for months to purchase my first laptop, knowing now it was the equivalent of a bomb. 
                I hope that this website helps others avoid the same fate.
